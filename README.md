# Crystals Collector Game!

This is an interactive game that works as instructed below. Enjoy!

    1. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

    2. You will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

    3. When you click on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the "player's" total score. 

    4. The game will hide this amount until you click a crystal.
      
    5. When you do click one, it updates the "player's" score counter.

    6. You win if your total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

    7. You lose if your score goes above the random number.

    8. The game restarts whenever you win or lose.

    9. When the game begins again, you will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, your score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

    10. The app will show the number of games you win and lose. Refreshing the page will not restart the game.
